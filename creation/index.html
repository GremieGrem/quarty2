	<p>We can finally make the commission page! Just to cover all grounds, I'm going to be demonstrating how to make a commission page that offers sketches to full renders and head shots to full body. Additionally, terms of service, personal limits, and add-on content.
	To start off, you can make a drawing of a character. Down below I have an illustration of my own character with each part of the drawing process laid out from sketches to full render.

	<p>For the first page of the commission page I have the sketch of my character. I’m going to break up each part of his body with these lines, creating a chart that shows what each size is and their corresponding price. To start, a head shot would be $5. With each progressing size, I add $5 to the original price. So we have $5 for headshot, $10 for bust shot, $15 for half body, and $20 for full.</p>

	<p>The next commission page will be formatted similarly, this time the prices will be higher by $5 more according to each size. This is because this page is specific to line art which would take more time and effort to do than a sketch. Headshots are $10 now, bust is $15, half is $20, and full is $25.</p>

	<p>The third page is the same. Once more, prices are higher than the last set by $5.</p>

	<p>Finally you land on the rendered page where your most expensive commissions will be. The format is the same, making it connect with each page.</p>

	<p>Next you have your terms of service. These will be policies you put into place about how you conduct your business and what you expect from your customers and clients when they commission you. Usually this will include steps they need to take in order to commission you along with what steps you will take to get their commission completed. I will give my personal example of TOS after i go over personal limits and add-ons.
	<br> Personal limits are things you can and cannot draw along with things you will and will not draw. I struggle to draw animals, so on my page i will include that i can’t draw that so if someone were to request that, i will not take the commission. As for items I will not draw, this could be considered something like hate art. It might be shocking that you would actually have to include that in your limits to notify people you will not draw that because of how harmful those pieces can be, but there are people out there that will ask for that type of art. <br> Similarly, there are also artists who will draw art regardless of the immorality of it. So for clarity’s sake, it’s important to include anything immortal you will refuse to draw. Typically this looks like a chart of ‘Do’s’ and ‘Don’t’s’. Do’s being that you are comfortable with drawing LGTBQ+ art and are capable of drawing human/humanoid characters. While Don’t’s being that you cannot draw robots and are uncomfortable with drawing any art depicting racism. </p>

	<div class='article'>
	<p>Finally there are add-ons which are not explicitly included - these can fall into the ‘Do’s’ of your personal limits as well. Usually, add-ons are extra prices added to the original/base price of the commission because it will take more time and effort to add this onto the piece. As an example, adding blood onto the piece could cost an extra $5. That’s on the low point, as another add-on could be additional characters. <br> Base commissions are assumed to only cover one character only, so artists will include in the add-ons how much it will cost to draw another character. Some artists will do +100% of the base price for each additional character. So if someone is requesting a $15, half body sketch and they want another character, the new price of that piece will be $30. You can set that percentage to be anything you wish. I personally set it to be +75% of base price for each additional character.</p>

	<div class='article'>
	<p>For commissions, I ask that my customers provide reference images of the character they want me to draw. I also ask that they give me a reference image of a pose they want, OR if they want me to come up with my own pose, then I will ask them to describe their character. Usually I want them to describe their personality traits, talk about the character’s background and story, and potentially include any props, accessories, or hobbies that the character has. This allows me to get a picture in my mind of who this character is and how they could potentially act and pose themselves. <br> Once all the information is given, I provide a very rough sketch of the pose(s) and send those to the client. Usually it will be one rough sketch if the client has provided a pose. If not, it will be 3 rough sketches to start as we negotiate which pose they like best. If those 3 are not liked, I create 2-3 more. These poses are free prior to me receiving payment and are not detailed enough for my art to be stolen.</p>

	<div class='article'>
	<p>After agreeing with the client on the pose they like, I calculate what the price will be. So let’s say this person asked me for a full body piece, fully rendered, with 3 characters. The rendered, full body’s base price is $35. With the additional 2 characters with the original base character, I need to take 75% of 35, multiply that by two then add that to the 35. That would make the total piece cost $87.50. Once paid, I begin work on the piece. With each step of the process, I send screenshots to the client. Starting with the basic sketch, I show the client and we make any adjustments to make the result be perfect. This communication encourages people to purchase from you again as it shows you are transparent and open to hearing critiques while catering to the specificities they want for their custom piece. <br> Next: FaQ
