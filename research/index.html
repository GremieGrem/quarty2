	<p>It is a good idea to look at other artists’ commission pages to get an understanding of how they conduct their own business. They always have a price set for whichever commission type they are selling.</p>

	<p>Some artists set up auctions, but those are typically for artists who have a large following, usually in the tens of thousands as it's more likely that a lot of people will participate in said auction. Set prices is the usual way to do it and most artists follow this type anyways.</p>

	<p>Some artists have flexible prices according to the variations they offer and some artists have a set price point with the conditions that need to be met. These conditions could be that they are specifically selling a fully rendered piece with two characters of choice and no drawn background. <br> It’s also important to look at what their prices are and compare it to their follower count, typically artists can have higher prices because they have a large audience, meaning there is more of a demand for their work. On the other side, artists with a small audience will have lower prices as there is less of a demand. <br> When coming up with the price for your art, it would be a good idea to talk to other friends and peers about their opinion for the price range. At the same time, this can be hurtful to hear or even surprising. When asking for how they would price one of your pieces, they could price it lower than you expected, or even higher. It’s best to keep an open mind when it comes to this as these are just their own perspectives, it doesn't make your art less valuable, it’s just an opinion. <br> Next: Compiling.</p>
