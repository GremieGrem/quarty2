		<h3>What art program is best for digital?</h3>
		<p>There are many art programs out there, usually this is a preference based on everyone’s own needs, likes, dislikes, and styles. There are a lot of free art programs out there like Medibang paint, Krita, GIMP, FireAlpaca, and Ibis Paint. There are also priced art programs like Clip Studio Paint (What i use), Procreate, Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, and Art Studio pro.</p>

		<h3>Can I apply this process to traditional art?</h3>
		<p>Yes! There will be some differences such as what you would be offering since that depends on what kind of traditional art it is, but this process for setting up traditional art commissions is relatively the same.</p>

		<h3>What are some websites I can post my commissions to?</h3>
		<p>Besides the Social Media sites you frequent (Bluesky, X/Twitter, Tumblr, Instagram, etc) there are places dedicated to commissioning artists only. This would be Fiverr, Etsy, Ko-Fi just to name a few marketplaces. There are also portfolio sites like DeviantArt, Behance, and Artstation.</p>
