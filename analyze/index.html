	<p>When it comes to making art, there are many steps that an artist naturally follows when creating their piece. Each person has a different way of going about it, but the process at its core stays relatively the same, especially with 2D digital art. It is common for artists to start with 1-2 sketch stages, transition into a line-art stage, a coloring stage, and finally a rendering stage. </p>

	<p>Similarly, this process can be helpful with determining how you want to do your commissions. Some people prefer to do general commissions with each one being a fully rendered piece, the price is set, terms from the artist are laid out, and it's as simple as that. Other artists like to give a large variety to their audience to select from.<br> That variety can be a number of things like pre-made poses, illustrations featuring multiple characters, character reference sheets, and commissions during the step by step process of art. We will be focusing on the latter as this can be one of the core features of your commissions. <br> This type allows you to sell commissions in the sketch phase, line art phase, coloring phase, or rendering phase. Starting with the sketch phase being the cheapest and rendering phase being the most expensive. Not all audiences like this type of commission, but it makes your art appear more accessible. For example, if a follower of yours wants to commission you, they cannot afford to purchase a full render but still wish to have your art and support you as an artist. They can still do this by purchasing one of the lower tiers, being a sketch, line art, or full color. They still get your art and you get their support. It works as a type of middle ground. Then, there are other aspects to take into account besides sketches, line art, coloring, and rendering. <br> Size is important. Typically, artists will arrange their sizes according to a character’s own person. </p>

		<p> It starts with a head shot which will be icons or profile pictures. Then a bust shot which is from the chest up and could also be an icon or profile picture. Next is the half body which is from the waist up. Half bodies offer more dynamic choices with the request as there is more of the character to work with. Finally, there is a full body which is the entire body of the character. Similarly, there is also more to potential with this type. Usually, head shots will be the cheapest and full body is the most expensive. So that covers both size and process. <br> Next: Research.</p>
