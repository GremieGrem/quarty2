	<p>Welcome to Quarty! A website dedicated towards providing a basic guide for making online commissions!</p>
	<p>As an artist who has done commissions in the past and has other artist friends, I have been asked for advice and help before when it came to setting up commissions. Today I will be demonstrating how to make a commission sheet and the processes I take to make one!</p>
	<p>There are a few steps to this process: Analyze, Research, Compiling, and Creation.</p>
	<p>To jump into the guide, press the 'Start' button. As you go through the pages there will be 'forward' and 'backward' buttons to help you go from page to page. If there is a specific page you want to go to, click on the 'contents' button.</p>
